<summary> Why I take Certifications? </summary>
<br>
 I am excited to share with you why I take certifications and the value they have brought to my career and personal growth.
<br><br>
First and foremost, I take certifications because they allow me to demonstrate my skills and expertise in a particular technology or subject matter. In today's competitive job market, having certifications can set you apart from other candidates and show potential employers that you have the knowledge and dedication required to succeed in your field.
<br>
<br>
In addition to helping me stand out in the job market, certifications have also helped me to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies. In the fast-paced world of technology, it is important to constantly learn and adapt, and certifications provide a structured way for me to do so.

**C**ertifications are not just about advancing my career. They have also helped me to grow as a person. 
- Earning a certification requires hard work, dedication, and a willingness to constantly learn and challenge myself. 

These traits are not only valuable in my career, but in all aspects of my life.

<summary> Are certifications pointless? </summary>
<br>

Those who claim that certifications do not matter either possess few or no certifications themselves and are attempting to emphasize the importance of their personal experience. While we certainly value experiences, it is also important to recognize that obtaining new certifications can broaden one's skillset and facilitate personal and professional growth. 
<br>
<br>
Consider the adage: are you having years of experiences or repeating the same year over and over?
<br>
<br>
Certs are a form of self-challenge and self-growth and my advice is to ignore most people because they do not have your best interests at heart.
