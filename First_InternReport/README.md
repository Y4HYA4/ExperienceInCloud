> Please do not use the provided as a reference to a case study. I did it for one reason; to become acquainted with book production. Why not write a book one day?

## Template
This is actually a good latex template to consider. LaTeX is a document preparation software system widely employed in creating books and I realized why.

- Consider [this file](aide-memoire_Latex.pdf) to learn about its syntax


The main file is where you should place your first focus: page-order & calling external tex files.

``` 
.LATEX_PROJECT
├── Main.tex
├── chapters.tex
├── Your inspiration.tex
├── assets
    ├── Pictures required, diagrams etc..

I took advantage of the opportunity to write my [CV](assets/CurriculumVitae.pdf) in Latex as well; A NEAT RESULT !
